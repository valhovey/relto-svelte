    Hi! My name is Val. I grew up in a small community in the Sierra Nevada
    mountains. In 2019, I graduated Utah State University with a BS in
    Computational Mathematics. My passions include mathematics, electrical
    engineering, programming, music, hiking, climbing, and philosophy. Here you
    can see some highlights from my past/current projects. Check out my blog for
    posts on math and programming.
